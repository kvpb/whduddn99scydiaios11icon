# `whduddn99`'s Cydia iOS 11 Icon
### `kvpb`'s rework of `whduddn99`'s redesign of the Cydia icon for iOS 11	![mwmac_badge.svg](https://gistcdn.githack.com/kvpb/e55c254ded3bc5eac9bc4f29c78ec75c/raw/3ed1cca704de2cb968baa5fabaf3eec5921d3a01/apple-F6F6F6D5E1ED1E72F21AD5FD-madeona-1AD5FD1E72F2-mac-F6F6F6D5E1ED.svg)

Without the original vector graphics file, I had to redraw `whduddn99`'s icon. On a part of the raster graphics file from his Reddit thread, I drew and edited shapes, then I colored the background with the color picker. Once I had faithfully counterfeited his icon, I worked on a copy to correct what I did not like:

 - The blocks have been edited to be sized identically.
 - The cardboard box has been made continuous.
 - The corner radiuses have been harmonized and made coherent.
 - The lines have been redrawn to be more parallel.
 - The spaces between many shapes have been stretched, partly as a side-effect of redimensioning and resizing the shapes.

Overall, the icon has been redrawn to look more natural, more continuous, more harmonious — cleaner. You can see the changes in detail by yourself on the nice picture just above.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About the installation, I simply loaded the 1024 square pixels file named `icon.png` in my iPhone 6, and I used [AppCon](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/org.thebigboss.appcon/) to apply it. For once, I'd rather a harder way to do it, but I didn't feel like redimensioning the icon for a hundred of sizes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I scratched this way less nicely than how I wipe my ass… As this is being typed, my computer's got three percent of juice left. Two, now.

#### To-do

- [ ] Get `whduddn99`'s vector graphics file
  -  [x] Or perfectly reproduce it from the raster one
- [x] Rework it to correct visual flaws
- [ ] Rework it again to size the 'shadows', ie the empty space between the shapes, like Apple's App Store icon's shadow-shaped empty spaces between the white rods
- [ ] Rework it once more to make it both visually and geometrically perfect
- [ ] Export a complete icon set for iOS 7-onwards and Retina-equipped devices
  - [ ] And maybe share the master file
